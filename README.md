Llama-RAG: Open-Source Document QnA System

Project Overview

This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built entirely using open-source tools. It allows users to upload a PDF document and receive intelligent, contextually grounded answers based solely on the content of that document.

This project is a high-impact portfolio piece demonstrating expertise in:

Generative AI: Implementing a full RAG pipeline.

Efficiency & Performance: Utilizing 4-bit quantization (bitsandbytes) for fast, local LLM inference.

Open-Source Stacks: Leveraging state-of-the-art Hugging Face models (LLama 3, BGE Embeddings).

Web Interface: Creating an interactive demo using Gradio.
